# Blog API Documentation

Welcome to the documentation for the Blog API. This API provides endpoints for managing a simple blogging platform, allowing users to create, read, update, and delete blog posts.

## Base URL

The base URL for all API endpoints is:

```
https://api.example.com/v1
```

## Authentication

Authentication is required for certain endpoints. Authentication is achieved via JSON Web Tokens (JWT). To authenticate, include the JWT token in the Authorization header of your requests.

Example:

```
Authorization: Bearer <JWT_TOKEN>
```

## Endpoints

### 1. Create a Blog Post

- **Endpoint:** `POST /posts`
- **Description:** Create a new blog post.
- **Request Body:**
  ```json
  {
    "title": "string",
    "content": "string"
  }
  ```
- **Response:** Returns the created blog post object.
- **Authorization:** Required

### 2. Get All Blog Posts

- **Endpoint:** `GET /posts`
- **Description:** Retrieve a list of all blog posts.
- **Response:** Returns an array of blog post objects.
- **Authorization:** Not required

### 3. Get a Single Blog Post

- **Endpoint:** `GET /posts/{postId}`
- **Description:** Retrieve a specific blog post by its ID.
- **Response:** Returns the blog post object.
- **Authorization:** Not required

### 4. Update a Blog Post

- **Endpoint:** `PUT /posts/{postId}`
- **Description:** Update an existing blog post.
- **Request Body:** 
  ```json
  {
    "title": "string",
    "content": "string"
  }
  ```
- **Response:** Returns the updated blog post object.
- **Authorization:** Required

### 5. Delete a Blog Post

- **Endpoint:** `DELETE /posts/{postId}`
- **Description:** Delete a specific blog post by its ID.
- **Response:** Returns a success message upon successful deletion.
- **Authorization:** Required

## Status Codes

- `200 OK`: The request was successful.
- `201 Created`: The resource was successfully created.
- `204 No Content`: The request was successful, but there is no content to return.
- `400 Bad Request`: The request was invalid or malformed.
- `401 Unauthorized`: Authentication is required to access the resource.
- `404 Not Found`: The requested resource does not exist.
- `500 Internal Server Error`: There was an unexpected error on the server.

## Rate Limiting

This API imposes rate limiting to prevent abuse. Exceeding the rate limit will result in a `429 Too Many Requests` response.

## Errors

Error responses follow standard HTTP status codes and include a JSON object with a message field describing the error.

Example Error Response:
```json
{
  "message": "Post not found"
}
```

This is a basic structure for documenting a simple Blog API. You can expand upon it by including more detailed explanations, example requests and responses, and additional features like search, pagination, or filtering.
